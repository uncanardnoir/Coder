# Problem Description
Consider the number 6. It has 4 divisors: 1, 2, 3 and 6. We say that the <b>Euler totient function</b> of $n$ which is denoted as $\phi(n)$ (the greek letter Phi) is equal to the number of divisors of $n$. So $\phi(6)$ equals 4.

Given a positive integer $n$ between 1 and 100, calculate $\phi(n)$
