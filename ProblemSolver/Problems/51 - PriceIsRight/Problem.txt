# Problem Description
In the Price Is Right, contestants are shown an item and have to guess the value of the item. The one who guesses closest without going over is the winner. In this problem, assume the value of the item is $1000. Given an array of integers up to length 30, each of which represents one contestant's guess, return an integer representing the value of the winning guess. For instance, if the guesses are [950, 980, 1001, 1010], the winning guess is 980. If none of the contestants won (all of their guess are too high), return -1.
