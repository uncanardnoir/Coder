# Problem Description
A Starry number is a number which is NOT divisible by 7, NOT divisible by 11, and divisible by 3. For instance, 6 is a Starry Number because it is divisible by 3 but not 7 or 11. But 21 and 77 are not Starry Numbers.

Given an array input of up to 300 integers, return a integer representing the total number of Starry Numbers in the array.
