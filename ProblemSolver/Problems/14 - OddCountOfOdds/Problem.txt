# Problem Description
(This is an extension of problems 3, 6, 9 and 10). Given an array of up to 200 integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ... a_n$, return the count of integers which fulfill the following two criteria:
1. The integer is an odd number
2. The integer is in an odd-numbered index (where we consider the first number to be index 1).

For instance, for the input $[2, 6, 5, 7, 10, 20]$ the answer is 1. The "2", "6", "10" and "20" do not count because they are not odd. The "7" does not count because it is in an even-numbered index (index 4).
