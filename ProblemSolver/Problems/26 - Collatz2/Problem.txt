# Problem Description
Consider again the Collatz conjecture from Problem 25: Start with any integer $n$. If $n$ is even, divide it by 2: $n = \frac{n}{2}$. If $n$ is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1: $n = 3n + 1$. The conjecture states that if you do this enough times with any number, you will eventually get to 1. The number of times we have to repeat the process is called the <b>length of the Collatz chain</b> of $n$.

Given an integer $k$ which is at most 1000, find the number $n$ where $1 \le n \le k$ such that $k$ has the longest Collatz chain out of any other number between 1 and $k$. For instance, if $k = 5$, we have:
$1$
$2 \to 1$
$3 \to 10 \to 5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1$
$4 \to 2 \to 1$
$5 \to 16 \to 8 \to 4 \to 2 \to 1$
The Collatz chain starting with 3 has the longest length out of all these (7), so the answer is 3. If there are multiple chains between 1 and $k$ with the same longest length, return the smallest one.
