# Problem Description
Postfix notation is a way of writing mathematical equations where the operator comes at the end of the operands, instead of the middle. For instance, instead of writing
$3 + 5$
We would instead write
$3 5 +$
As another example, $5 3 4 - *$ in postfix means $5 * (3 - 4)$ in our "standard" notation.
Given a string where each character represents either a single-digit number 0 through 9 or one of three operations + - * and the string itself represents an expression in postfix notation, evaluate the expression.
