# Problem Description
Consider again our escaping rules from problem 32. An "escaped string" is one where:
1. Every quotation mark (") is preceded by a backslash <b>\"</b>
2. Every single quotation mark (') is preceded by a backslash: <b>\'</b>
3. Every question mark (?) is preceded by a backslash: <b>\?</b>
4. Every tab character (	) is represented as <b>\t</b>
5. Every backslash (\) is represented as two backslashes <b>\\</b>

Given an escaped string as an input, return the original unescaped string. You may assume the input is always a valid escaped string.
