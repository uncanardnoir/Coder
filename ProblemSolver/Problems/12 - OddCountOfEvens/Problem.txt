# Problem Description
(This is an extension of problems 3, 6, 9 and 10). Given an array of up to 200 integers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ... a_n$, return the count of integers which fulfill the following two criteria:

1. The integer is an even number
2. The integer is in an odd-numbered index (where we consider the first number to be index 1).

For instance, for the input $[2, 6, 5, 7, 10, 20]$ the answer is 1. The "5" and "7" do not count because they are not even. The "6" and "20" do not count because they are in an even-numbered index (the "6" is at index 2 and the "20" is at index 6).
